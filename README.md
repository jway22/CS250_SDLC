How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs is done by interviewing, polling, and other forms of communication that help get the required functionality for a program. To implement them, a programmer (or for Scrum agile - a Product Owner) must figure out the best way to generalize the user's needs so that the developers can put it into code. This is done by creating user stories. The user story can have a general idea of what needs to be done, and then the Product Owner can break it down into more "code lingo" so that the developers know what's expected of the program.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I guess I tend to develop with an agile mindset. I like to work on code in small batches, focusing on a couple functions at a time and testing them to the best of my ability within the porgram I am building. Then I like to add another function or two and make adjustments to previous functions so that they all interact nicely with each other, then test them again. Rinse and repeat!

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in anything requires that you put a good amount of effort into what needs to be done. For software development, this means making sure you stick to deadlines and complete the code that is being required of you. In a larger team, you might be focusing on a function or two that will be added into a program that other team members are working on as well. If you aren't completing your work than the other team members and the programs development will suffer since your work will be necessary for the program's functionality.
